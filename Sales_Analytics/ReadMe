# Sales Data Analysis – Functional Programming

This project demonstrates functional programming, custom stream operations, lambda expressions, and analytical processing on a sales dataset using Python. It includes modular components for data loading, transformation, stream-style operations, and business-level aggregations.

## Features
- Functional programming with pure transformation functions
- Custom stream-like operators: filter, map, sorted_by, limit, skip, distinct, reduce_sum, reduce_custom
- Lambda expressions used across filtering, mapping, derived fields, and aggregations
- Aggregation analytics: revenue by region, item type, channel, priority, month, and year
- High-value orders, low-margin categories, and top profitable items per region
- Complete unit test suite (27 tests) using pytest

## Dataset
Download:
https://excelbianalytics.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/5000-Sales-Records.zip

Extract and rename the CSV file to:
sales_data.csv

Place it in the same directory as main.py.

## Setup
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install pandas pytest

## Running the Analysis
python3 main.py

The script prints:
- Dataset summary
- Stream operations demonstration
- Analytical aggregations
- Lambda-based calculations
- Monthly, regional, and item-level insights

## Running Tests
pytest

Expected output:
27 passed

## Deliverables Completed
- Public GitHub repository
- Complete source code
- Unit tests for all analysis methods
- README with setup instructions
- Full analysis results printed to console
